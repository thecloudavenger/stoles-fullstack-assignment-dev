It will draw on the research findings from 17-003 to determine what is required and identify solutions which fit these requirements. \n      This project will identify existing, near to market and novel approaches for technological solutions suitable for use on the current and future GB rail network and make recommendations based on the expected benefits, cost and impact of these solutions.\n      The solutions will provide drivers with an indication of train stopping position that correlates with train length and ensure all passenger doors intended for use are accommodated within the platform. The indication should ideally be presented in-cab, clearly visible from the driver`s normal seated position, thus reducing the need for a side view window to be provided as part of the train build design. Other technological examples include the introduction of dynamic illuminated signage which detects the specific train arriving and provides tailored information on the stopping position.\n      This will enable the industry to determine its future path with relation to enabling drivers to stop trains in the correct position at stations.\n      Following completion of this project it is envisaged trialling of suitable solutions could be undertaken.','4868ef41-eb50-4c28-a958-b226e1f40bb5','2020-11-12','2020-12-09','75000','GBP',NULL,'2020-11-12 23:45:32.126906','TENDER'),

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal. Early research by the UK Space Growth Partnership (SGP) indicates that the role of Government as an `anchor customer` in procurement could provide an important element in ensuring an innovative and competitive space market in the UK, and provide leverage into the global market for UK companies. The SGP has considered in particular the impact for Government securing access to new and early services, influencing industry developments to meet public sector needs, transferring risk to the private sector and achieving better value for money than traditional R&D and procurement programmes. In addition, the SGP has considered the soft power benefits as Government becomes the smart customer of the future and promotes the UK`s international reputation as an innovation leader in important market segments.\n\nThe SGP review of the `anchor customer` principle included consideration of many satellite communications and Earth observation examples in other countries, as well as the role NASA has played in using public procurement to stimulate the US commercial launch sector, where SpaceX has now emerged as a global leader.\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate innovative procurement mechanisms as a tool for establishing global leadership in the space sector. The study should specifically assess the anchor customer principle for its ability to:\n•	attract private investment\n•	deliver practical procurement processes that work in a range of market situations\n•	set UK businesses apart as leaders for reliable service delivery\n•	accelerate technology innovation\n•	stimulate jobs and growth across the UK, explicitly aligning domestic requirements and the drive for exports\n\n\n\nHow to Apply UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) will be using the Delta eSourcing Portal for this procurement.

It is our hope to create a nationally important visitor destination within Sandown; enhancing the museum’s appeal as an attraction, and further developing its potential as an important regional educational centre and a world-class scientific resource. We are seeking a partner to help us improve the physical facilities and deliver overall long-term governance, while assuring the museum’s continued participation in the museum accreditation standard. We are spreading the net widely for potential partners to ensure the best potential future for the museum and the town. To achieve this, we will be promoting this opportunity internationally to identify a partner with the track record, expertise and vision to take forward our aspirations and fulfil the full potential of Dinosaur Isle. As such, we would welcome responses from public sector, private sector and voluntary sector organisations, and mixed consortia. Following a Soft Market Testing exercises in October 2017 and Stakeholder Consultation in November 2017, and considering comments and issues raised, the Council made a decision in May 2018 to seek a Development Partner for the museum through a formal procurement process. The process will be based on a multi-stage “Competitive Procedure with Negotiation”. However, as a museum service falls under the Light Touch Regime (Regulations 74-77 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015) the process has not been prescribed as detailed by Regulation, and is being designed to suit the specific requirements of this procurement. At each stage of the process bidders will be assessed based on information submitted and some may be eliminated if they do not score sufficiently against the criteria. Only those bidders remaining at the appropriate stage will be invited to submit Final Tenders. At the conclusion of the process, the Council intends to form an agreement with the successful bidder to work alongside the Council as the Development Partner in manner in accordance with their Final Tender. The Development Partner must invest in and operate the museum so as to develop its role as an accredited museum acting as a significant visitor attraction for the Isle of Wight. In return they will secure a contract to operate the museum with a long-lease for the site and rights to a proportion of any income generated. It is expected that the Council and Development Partner will commit to redesigning and delivering an enhanced Dinosaur Isle Museum (the Museum) within three-years of the conclusion of the selection process. The term of the contract will be determined via this process; however, the Council will be prepared to issue a lease of up to 125 years, subject to conditions.

The last should be a larger robot, able to move around and capable of interacting with objects on a table.\nWe require the robots for the following activities within the IROHMS lab:\nChildren’s interaction with robotic technology. This stream of work centres on enhancing the acceptability and reliability of humanoid robot interactions for children. Using CUCHDS’ existing neuroimaging technologies, this can explore the activation of social neural networks during CRI and use this to inform basic robotics development. Complementary psychological experimental paradigms that will inform these advancements include movement paradigms, perspective taking, eye-gaze cueing and joint attention. Atypically developing children, particularly autistic children, may perceive a humanoid robot’s appearance and behaviours differently from other children. Thus, the work will also focus on adapting humanoid robots to meet individual differences.\nSocial cognition and behaviour. This stream capitalises on the breadth of CUCHDS research that explores social cognition and behaviour. For example, combined with motion capture software, we will use time-series analysis to offer a fine-grained exploration of the social synchrony between child and robot, with CRI offering experimental control not afforded in human-human interactions. Further, autistic children may find humanoid robots more predictable and easier to understand than humans, which offers exciting possibilities for exploring social strategies and interaction styles. As well as informing basic understanding of social cognition and behaviour in typical and atypical development, this work has potential to lead to interventions for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and emotional and behavioural difficulties.\nIntegration with existing IROHMS capabilities. Other zones within the IROHMS lab, such as the transport simulator and immersive dome (Igloo) provide opportunities for using different technologies to explore Human-Robot Interaction scenarios.

The project scope is to build and fly a satellite quantum key distribution (QKD) test bed. Through this collaboration, Singapore and the UK will co-develop a satellite called "Speqtre"", a satellite based on the CubeSat standard that will use a pioneering QKD technology to test the secure distribution of cryptographic keys over globe-spanning distances. Quantum Key Distribution provides an alternative that can be seamlessly integrated onto the network systems we already use. It is resistant to all known computational attacks, including from future quantum computers. The project was kicked off around Feb 2019 and is currently around PDR stage. The satellite is expected to be launched around Q3/Q4 2023. In the UK, work will be led by the STFC, responsible for the development of the platform (BUS) and the optical payload for optical links needed for beaming QKD signals, known as the `Optical Payload`.
